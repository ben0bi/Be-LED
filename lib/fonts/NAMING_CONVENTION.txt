It is not necessary but please use this naming convention:

LED_charset_					// every charset should have the name charset in it.
		monospace_			// for fonts where every char has the same size.
		multispace_			// a font where the font (width) can differ from each other.
				WxH		// the width and height of a standard character like A. 
						//	(NOT like q or AE (I don t have the char on the keyboard..an A with 2 dots over it.))
					(WxH)	// The real size of a char, including blank lines and such.

E.g.
	LED_charset_multispace_Wx7(Wx10).js	// A font with varying width and a height of 7 pixels. 
						// In real, the font has 2 blank lines on top and one on the bottom, so it is Wx10 big.
						// (Also, each char should have a blank line on the left and right.)
